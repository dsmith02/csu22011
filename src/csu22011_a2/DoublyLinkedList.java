/**
 * Class DoublyLinkedList: implements a *generic* Doubly Linked List.
 *
 * @param <T> This is a type parameter. T is used as a class name in the
 *            definition of this class.
 *            <p>
 *            When creating a new DoublyLinkedList, T should be instantiated with an
 *            actual class name that extends the class Comparable.
 *            Such classes include String and Integer.
 *            <p>
 *            For example to create a new DoublyLinkedList class containing String data:
 *            DoublyLinkedList<String> myStringList = new DoublyLinkedList<String>();
 *            <p>
 *            The class offers a toString() method which returns a comma-separated sting of
 *            all elements in the data structure.
 *            <p>
 *            This is a bare minimum class you would need to completely implement.
 *            You can add additional methods to support your code. Each method will need
 *            to be tested by your jUnit tests -- for simplicity in jUnit testing
 *            introduce only public methods.

     * <p>
     * Justification:
     * The code consists of the lines before the for-loop, the for-loop itself and the lines after the for-loop.
     * <p>
     * The lines before the for loop involve
     * - the creation of a StringBuilder object which does not depend on the length of the list. Therefore it takes Theta(1) time.
     * - the allocation and assignment of two variables which are constant time operations.
     * Thus the code before the for-loop will take Theta(1) time to run.
     * <p>
     * The lines after the for-loop involve a single return instruction and thus take Theta(1) time.
     * <p>
     * The for-loop itself will iterate over all elements of the DLL. Thus it will perform Theta(N) iterations.
     * Each iteration will involve:
     * * The if-conditional will run:
     * - the if-then-else conditions and branching, which are constant time operations. Thus these cost Theta(1) time.
     * - The then-branch of the conditional calls StringBuilder's append() method, which (from the Java documentation) we know it runs in Theta(1) time.
     * - the else-branch of the conditional involves a single assignment, thus runs in Theta(1) time.
     * Therefore the if-then-else conditions will cost Theta(1) in the worst case.
     * * The final call to StringBuilder's append will cost again Theta(1)
     * * the nested call to toString() will cost time proportional to the length of the strings (but not the length of the list).
     * Assuming strings are relatively small compared to the size of the list, this cost will be Theta(1).
     * Therefore each iteration of the loop will cost Theta(1).
     * Thus the lines involving the for-loop will run in Theta(N)*Theta(1) = Theta(N).
     * <p>
     * Therefore this method will run in Theta(1) + Theta(1) + Theta(N) = Theta(N) time in the worst case.
